    "aiAnalysis": {
        "observation": "An analysis of the contest rejection data reveals that 100.0% of rejected candidates lacked the required skills, indicating a significant mismatch between candidate qualifications and job requirements. This trend suggests the need for a more rigorous screening process to ensure candidates possess essential skills before application. The absence of score data precludes correlation analysis, but it's crucial to incorporate scoring metrics in evaluations. Systemic issues may arise from inadequate job postings, ineffective sourcing strategies, or unrealistic requirement setting, which can be benchmarked against industry standards to identify gaps.",
        "recommendedAction": "Implement a comprehensive skills assessment early in the hiring process to filter unqualified candidates. Utilize skills testing tools and platforms to automate this step. Revise job descriptions and requirements to better reflect actual job needs and attract suitable candidates. Establish clear communication channels with applicants to manage expectations and provide feedback. Regularly review industry reports and best practices to align hiring strategies with current trends and standards."
